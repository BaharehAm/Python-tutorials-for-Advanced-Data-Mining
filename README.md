# Python-tutorials-for-Advanced-Data-Mining

This repository is a collection of tutorials designed to support students enrolled in the Advanced Data Mining course, at John Molson School of Business, Concordia University. 

As a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Advanced Data Mining course, I had the privilege of supporting students on their Python programming journey. My goal was to make the learning process enjoyable and effective, providing clear explanations and practical exercises.
